# Animal Crossing(NL)-Donations List 
>"Sometimes, you have to do it yourself." -me(?)

- Have you ever tried to donate every DONATE-ABLE item, but you can't catch a hint from your encyclopedia about what you still need to donate;
  And you check the wikis, you realize that you have to point out what you yet to donate from a huge list.

- Have you ever caught something, looked at your encyclopedia to see that you already caught it before,
but still not sure if you donated it or not.

- Have you ever left a save file for a long time, for months, years even, and __god forbid__ you sold everything for bells,
and didn't bother to donate at that time.

Let me tell you; I have the ~solu-~ script, I have a script to store what you did and didn't donate.

### Notes before downlaoding:
1. This code made to be dynamic, it can be a checklist for anything.
   - And with a '.py' script to automatically add 'titles' of items from [nookipedia](https://nookipedia.com/wiki/Main_Page);
   - so you can make your own Animal_Crossing_list.txt. P.S. it takes almost every title of the page, so you will need to clean the '.txt'.

>[!TIP]
>Even if you aren't going to tinker with any of the files, you should read the code(any code you get from the internet) before downloading it.
